Is this thing fucking on?
=========================

I have a really bad habit of committing myself entirely to an endeavor and flaming out a couple of weeks later. The running joke is that I'm simply a blacksmith working with too many irons in the fire ***eternally***. Just a month ago I publicly announced that I was going to build a pentesting firm focused on CMMC compliance testing. A month before that, I vibe coded a passive asset inventory tool for ICS networks. Today... well, I'm not doing any of that shit. To be fair, I've always done this, but it's getting worse. I am in career ***hell***. But I may have found a path and only time will tell if it's my escape or yet another iron in the fire. 

It's All Their Fault
-------------------

The cyber security industry is a joke. Has it always been? Am I just insanely naive (yes)? Am I jaded from my experiences or perception of events? The good - people. The bad - people. It doesn't matter if it's the government, some Fortune 1-500 company, or Gartner's best bullshit of the year product company, (I've seen quite a bit because I burn out of every job after two years from witnessing too many ***skeletons***) the people make or break every experience. Take the below with a grain of salt, don't let others influence your goals, but maybe consider their limited perspective.

### - The Government

My raw and unpolished take? It's a monolithic carcass. Pockets of good people trying to make a positive change only to be smashed down over and over by internal (and external) politics, bureaucracy, and incompetence. I've seen heads roll over absolutely nothing, assessment reporting weaponized to remove those that don't play ball. I've seen heads stay on shoulders after witnessing program managers fail spectacularly (like assessing and having the **same exact findings** multiple years in a row). It is ***soul*** crushing to work 16+ hours a day just to find out months later that the report you delivered was massaged as it moved up the chain to make programs look better than they are. I highly recommend [The Pentagon Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon_Wars) for a closer look. It's not all bad and it can be highly rewarding, but with all things, what is sold and what is received are two vastly different things.


### - The Private Industry

 The private industry has its own set of issues, don't be fooled, they slapped lipstick on that pig. I have experienced three paths primarily, product, consulting, and internal security team work. If it's product or consulting, it's all marketing and sales. Every bit of it. Sales and marketing driving operational decisions and R&D. People are obsessed with Gartner scores, self backpats with Top - who gives a shit - awards, and social media engagement. I've witnessed elite firms fail to scope properly, compromise public assets, and then reach out to asset owners and use the incident as a sales pitch for future assessment services. My favorite example was being told that a $5,000 password cracking rig was unobtainable and then watched as a million dollars got dropped on a BlackHat booth that was a glorified [pew pew map](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/). An internal team (caution: cost center), in my opinion, is the best of the three but you'll find yourself lobbying to justify your existence constantly. You can make real money in any of the three paths but there is always an associated cost.


It's All My Fault
----------------

I can point fingers all day but the reality is, I'm incredibly lucky. I am fortunate enough to have had all of these opportunities, that people put their faith in me to deliver, that they would be willing to bring me into the fold. Was I always this cynical? I remember being excited, hungry to prove myself, and interested in cool hacker shit. Somewhere along the way I grew sour, spiteful, and disinterested. I got into this because I didn't want to work outside on F-16s for the Air Force and looking back, man that was a cool fucking job. I hated it then, I was completely ignorant to what I was supporting, but I had a purpose. Everything after that has just been endless searching for a cause to rally behind and constantly let down that the thing that I envisioned fixing all of my problems was a facade.

### - Woe Is Me

The problem isn't them, it's me. I've become this salty, jaded, veteran of both the military and cyber industry and I don't know how to escape it. I know that I'm tired of making money for other people or protecting rich entities assets. I'm tired of being the "Wizard of Oz" behind the garbage product. I'm tired of feeling fraudulent for only knowing how to utilize other people's tools and products, yet having contributed nothing of value or substance myself. I've built this career on being a "tool monkey", and then am somehow shocked that the only roles I land are more operational tool monkey roles that's led to further disgruntlement. I know that I'm flailing and am at this point performing public self-flagellation.

Enlightenment Through Pain
--------------------------

I need stability. Something that I can chip away at, something that gives me purpose in my work life. I don't have a clear cut answer but I've settled on something that is most certainly masochistic. ***I'm going to write a simple linux C2***. Maybe the most cliche statement I could make (look at how many failed or otherwise unfinished attempts that exist on github). The vision I have is for it to be as polished as something like Sliver. Focused on linux endpoints, cloud pivoting, maybe even something I have no understanding of like container escapes. I don't expect this to solve any of my "dog chasing car" problems, but it's certainly something I can always come back to. I'm going to build it publicly. I don't have a fucking clue on where to begin or how to get started, even after years of pentesting and red team engagements (tool dev is its own discipline). Sure I can emulate existing frameworks, ask AI, blah blah blah. I'm not doing this to have a marketable product, however, I'm doing this to reignite what I once lost. I am going to make tremendously stupid decisions and break stuff and for me, that's where real learning takes place. That's where the real fun in this career field is. I never enjoyed this for the glory, the money, or whatever else. It's always been about the (controlled) ***chaos***. I've watched this industry darken, technology become exploitative, and companies thriving on greed. Maybe my ***Avarice*** will be a fitting reflection.
