  <h1 id="is-this-thing-fucking-on">Is this thing fucking on?</h1>
<p>I have a really bad habit of commiting myself entirely to an endeavor and flaming out a couple of weeks later. The running joke is that I&rsquo;m simply a blacksmith working with too many irons in the fire <em><strong>eternally</strong></em>. Just a month ago I publicly announced that I was going to build a pentesting firm focused on CMMC compliance testing. A month before that, I vibe coded a passive asset inventory tool for ICS networks. Today&hellip; well, I&rsquo;m not doing any of that shit. To be fair, I&rsquo;ve always done this, but its getting worse. I am in career <em><strong>hell</strong></em>. But I may have found a path and only time will tell if its my escape or yet another iron in the fire.</p>
<h2 id="its-all-their-fault">Its All Their Fault</h2>
<p>The cyber security industry is a joke. Has it always been? Am I just insanely naive (yes)? Am I jaded from my experiences or perception of events? The good - people. The bad - people. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if its the government, some Fortune 1-500 company, or Gartners best bullshit of the year product company, (I&rsquo;ve seen quite a bit because I burn out of every job after two years from witnessing too many <em><strong>skeletons</strong></em>) the people make or break every experience. Take the below with a grain of salt, don&rsquo;t let others influence your goals, but maybe consider their limited perspective.</p>
<h3 id="--the-government">- The Government</h3>
<p>The outside - a great mission. Bigger than yourself impact. All of that rrrrrrrrred / white / blue feels.</p>
<p>The inside - a monolithic carcass. Pockets of good people trying to make a positive change only to be smashed down over and over by internal (and external) politics, bearucracy, and incompetance. I&rsquo;ve seen heads roll over absolutely nothing, assessment reporting weaponized to remove those that don&rsquo;t play ball. Ive seen heads stay on shoulders after witnessing program managers fail spectactularly (like assessing and having the <strong>same exact findings</strong> multiple years in a row). It is <em><strong>soul</strong></em> crushing to work 16+ hours a day just to find out months later that the report you delivered was massaged as it moved up the chain to make programs look better than they are. I highly recommend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon_Wars" target="_blank">The Pentagon Wars</a> for a closer look. Its not all bad and it can be highly rewarding, but with all things, what is sold and what is received are two vastly different things.</p>
<h3 id="--the-private-industry">- The Private Industry</h3>
<p>The outside - working with elite teammates to solve an industry problem. Maybe earn some walking around cash. From an operator or pentesting standpoint you either consult, work with a product, or deliver on an internal team.</p>
<p>The inside - It depends. If its product or consulting, its all marketing and sales. Every bit of it. Sales and marketing driving operational decisions and R&amp;D. People are obsessed with Gartner scores, self backpats with Top - who gives a shit - awards, and social media engagement. I&rsquo;ve witnessed elite firms fail to scope properly, comprimise public assets, and then reach out to asset owners and use the incident as a sales pitch for future assessment services. My favorite example was being told that a $5000 password cracking rig was unobtainable and then watch as a million dollars get dropped on a BlackHat booth that was a glorified <a href="https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/" target="_blank">pew pew map</a>. An internal team (caution: cost center), in my opinion, is the best of the three but you&rsquo;ll find yourself lobbying to justify your existance constantly. You can make real money in any of the three paths but there is always an associated cost.</p>
<h2 id="its-all-my-fault">Its All My Fault</h2>
<p>I can point fingers all day but the reality is, I&rsquo;m incredibly lucky. I am fortunate enough to have had all of these oppurtunities, that people put their faith in me to deliver, that they would be willing to bring me into the fold. Was I always this cynnical? I remember being excited, hungry to prove myself, and interested in cool hacker shit. Somewhere along the way I grew sour, spiteful, and disinterested. I got into this because I didn&rsquo;t want to work outside on F-16&rsquo;s for the Air Force and looking back, man that was a cool fucking job. I hated it then, I was completely ignorant to what I was supporting, but I had a purpose. Everything after that has just been endless searching for a cause to rally behind and constantly let down that the thing that I envisioned fixing all of my problems was a facade.</p>
<h3 id="--woe-is-me">- Woe Is Me</h3>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t them, its me. I&rsquo;ve become this salty, jaded, veteran of both the military and cyber industry and I don&rsquo;t know how to escape it. I know that I&rsquo;m tired of making money for other people or protecting rich entities assets. I&rsquo;m tired of being the &ldquo;Wizard of Oz&rdquo; behind the garbage product. I&rsquo;m tired of feeling fraudulent for only knowing how to utilize other peoples tools and products, yet having contributed nothing of value or substance myself. I&rsquo;ve built this career on being a &ldquo;tool monkey&rdquo;, and then am somehow shocked that the only roles I land are more operational tool monkey roles thats lead to further disgruntlement. I know that I&rsquo;m flailing and am at this point performing public self-flagellation.</p>

<p>I need stability. Something that I can chip away at, something that gives me purpose in my work life. I don&rsquo;t have a clear cut answer but I&rsquo;ve settled on something that is most certainly masochistic. <em><strong>I&rsquo;m going to write a simple linux C2</strong></em>. Maybe the most cliche statement I could make (look at how many failed or otherwise unfinished attempts that exist on github). The vision I have is for it to be as polished as something like Sliver. Focused on linux endpoints, cloud pivoting, maybe even something I have no understanding of like container escapes. I don&rsquo;t expect this to solve any of my &ldquo;dog chasing car&rdquo; problems, but its certainly something I can always come back to. I&rsquo;m going to build it publicly. I don&rsquo;t have a fucking clue on where to begin or how to get started, even after years of pentesting and red team engagements (tool dev is its own discipline). Sure I can emulate existing frameworks, ask AI, blah blah blah. I&rsquo;m not doing this to have a marketable product, however, I&rsquo;m doing this to reignite what I once lost. I am going to make tremendously stupid decisions and break stuff and for me, thats where real learning takes place. Thats where the real fun in this career field is. I never enjoyed this for the glory, the money, or whatever else. Its always been about the (controlled) <em><strong>chaos</strong></em>. I&rsquo;ve watched this industry darken, technology become exploitive, and companies thriving on greed. Maybe my <em><strong>Avarice</strong></em> will be a fitting reflection.</p>
